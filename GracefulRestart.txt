Graceful Restart:

    An OSPF router restarts its routing process:
        -> Your neighbors stop receiving Hello Packets
        -> Dead timer expires:
        --> Down state
        --> New LSA, therefore new SPF calculations

    OSPF router recovers:
        -> reestablish adjacencies
        -> Neighbors reflood their LSAs:
        --> rerun SPF algorithm

    To solve delays transmissions or dropped packets:
        -> Graceful restart (or hitless start):
        --> restart a routing process without causing network instability
        -> Conditions to perfom Graceful Restart:
        --> capable of forwarding packtes while processing is restarting (routing and forwarding planes separated)
        --> network topology must be stable
        --> neighbors must support the graceful restart process

    Restart Operation:
        -> a restart is about to start
        -> Restart Candidate:
        --> restarting router stores the CURRENT FORWARDING table in memory + CURRENT ADJANCIES + NETWORK CONFIGURATION and send a NOTIFICATION
        -> asks each neighbor for assistance:
        --> Helper:
        ---> receives a notification message, maintains Full adj and DO NOT flood new LSA
        --> Possible Helper:
        ---> default operational state

    Grace LSA:
        -> message exchanged between the restart candidate and the helper (LSA type 9 - link-local)
        -> opaque type: 3 (8 bits), opaque ID: 0 (24 bits) + TLV 
        -> Grace Period (1):
        --> after this timer expires the Helper flushes the Adj and floods LSAs
        -> Hitless Restard Reason (2):
        --> 0 - Unknown, 1 - Software restart, 2 - Software upgrade/reload, 3 - switch to redundant control processor
        -> IP Interface Address (3):
        --> grace LSA on a brodcast or NBMA network. So neighbors can identify the restating router
